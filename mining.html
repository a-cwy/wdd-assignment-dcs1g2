        <h2>What is crypto mining?</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            Cryptocurrency mining is a computationally complex process where
            cryptocurrency transactions are validated. As a reward for
            validating the transaction, the valdiator is given a sum of
            cryptocurrency based on the transaction that was validated. People
            who are involved in this process of cryptocurency mining are known
            as miners.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whenever new transactions are made, they have to be validated. Just
            as a bank will undergo a long and secure process of making sure that
            money transactions are valid, the blockchain will perform a process
            of finding a valid hash key for each transaction, validating it in
            the process. However, unlike a bank where validation is done by the
            authorities, transaction validation is done by the public in the
            blockchain. Miners will use hardware and machinery that can perform
            calculations at lightning speed such graphical processing units and
            special made calculation processors to compute valid hash keys for
            each transaction. The speed of said hardware is key to mining
            cryptocurrency as only the first person to succesfully validate a
            transaction is rewarded with cryptocurrency.

      <h2 class="subHead">Wait, whats a <span>Blockchain?</span></h2>

      <div class="blockchainExplanation">
        <p>
          The blockchain is essentially a chain of legders in which transactions
          are recorded and broadcasted into the public domain. This ledger can
          be accessed and appended to by anyone, but every edit is required to
          be validated before it can be added to the blockchain. This
          validation, is in essence what cryptocurency mining is.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whenever a new ledger is created, it needs to be appended to the
          blockchain along with a hashing function that is appropriate for the
          said ledger for the ledger to be valid. Unfortunately, there aren't
          many efficient methods to find the hashing function for a given
          ledger, so many people opt to brute force their way into finding the
          correct hashing function. This is done by generating multiple hashing
          funtions in rapid succession, such as with the use of specially made
          computing processors or GPUs, and testing the hashing functions on the
          ledger to see if they are valid hashing functions. If one is found,
          the ledger is then appended to the blockchain with its hashing
          function, validating the ledger and all the transactions listed
          within.
