  <!--About Bitcoin-->
  <h1>Litecoin (LTC)</h1>
  <!--Origin-->
  <div> 
    <h2>Origin</h2>
    <p>
      Litecoin is a cryptocurrency that was created by a former Google engineer called Charlie Lee in October 2011. 
      Lee developed Litecoin as a "lite" version of Bitcoin, with the aim of addressing some of the perceived limitations 
      of Bitcoin while maintaining its core principles. 
    </p>
  </div>
  <!--History-->
  <div>
    <h2>Brief History</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Creation (2011) :</strong>
      Litecoin was created by Charlie Lee, and was launched on 7 October 2011.
      It was designed as a "lite" version of Bitcoin which use a similar decentralized and blockchain-based system with Bitcoin.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Early Growth (2011–2016) :</strong>
      In November 2013, the aggregate value of Litecoin experienced massive growth which included a 100% leap within 24 hours.
      In early 2014, Lee suggested merge mining (auxPOW) Dogecoin with Litecoin.
      In September 2014, Dogecoin began merge-mining with Litecoin. 
      This make both cryptocurrencies stronger and more secure.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>PayPal and Fake Walmart Partnership Impact Litecoin (2017-2021) :</strong>
      In 2020, PayPal introduced the option to buy Litecoin, along with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Bitcoin Cash, as part of its 
      Crypto feature, but these tokens couldn't be withdrawn or spent.
      In September 2021, GlobeNewswire released a fake press release, announcing a partnership between Litecoin and Walmart.
      This caused the price of Litecoin to increase by around 30%.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Continue Upgrading (2022–now) :</strong>
      In May 2022, the Litecoin network activated the MWEB (Mimblewimble Extension Blocks) upgrade, allowing users to 
      send private Litecoin transactions where only the sender and receiver know the amount being sent.
      In June 2022, PayPal allowed users to transfer Litecoin, along with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Bitcoin Cash 
      between their PayPal accounts and other wallets and exchanges.
